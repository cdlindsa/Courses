Coding assignments from previous courses.<br>
<br>
CSC230: Introduction to Computer Architecture<br>
Language(s): Assembly for AtmelMega2560<br>
Course Instructor: Dr. LillAnne Jackson<br>
Assignment 3: Calculates the difference of 3 constant values and stores the result in data segment memory location (result)<br>
Assignment 5: Simulates a scrolling message with an approximate 1 second delay that is displayed on an LCD screen. Due to COVID-19 closures, instead writes to locations in data segment memory rather than displays to an LCD.<br>
<br>

Assignment 1 (C): Use Run-Length Encoding as a lossless data compression technique to condense the repetitive parts of DNA sequences.<br>
Assignment 2 (C): Use LZW data compression technique to encode and decode various filetypes.<br>
Assignment 3 (Python): Implementation of basic OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).<br>

Other Contributors to Projects (in Alphabetical Order; Last Name, First Name): Drummond, Cameron; Kawach, Omar; Leung, Kelvin; Zhang, Shuhao (Paul)<br>
Description: Our group was tasked with constructing and user testing a theoretical financial management application according to taught design principles.<br>
Assignment 2: User research and storyboard results.<br>
Assignment 3: Low-fidelity prototyping and heuristic evaluation.<br>
Assignment 4: Medium fidelity prototype description and plan for user evaluation.<br>
Assignment 5: Final user evaluation.<br>
Assignment 6a: Reflection and final presentation.<br>
Assignment 6b (Individual): Peer review of another group's project (COVID Tracker).<br>
<br>
SENG321: Requirements Engineering<br>
Language(s): N/A<br>
Course Instructor: Dr. Jens Weber<br>
Other Contributors to Projects (in Alphabetical Order; Last Name, First Name): Abdulaziz, Omar; Kumar, Siddhant; Makhani, Amaan; Parkes, Jon; Vellethara, Elizabeth<br>
Description: As a 'Client', Big Bucks Bank, our group was tasked with constructing a Requirements Document requesting a solution for increasing the amount of client investments at our institution (RD1.0). As a 'Designer', Inventoria, our group was tasked to solve the issue of a convenience store (Kevin's Convenience Store) looking to reduce physical inventory documentation. Through RSD1.0 - RSD_Final, we developed a theoretical web-based application to solve this issue.<br>
<br>
SENG330: Object Oriented Programming<br>
Language(s): Java<br>
Course Instructor: Neil Ernst<br>
Assignment 1 (Java): Create a simple Dungeons and Dragons battle.<br>
<br>
SENG474: Data Mining (Machine Learning)<br>
Language(s): Python 3.7<br>
Course Instructor: Dr. Nishant Mehta<br>
Other Contributors to Projects (in Alphabetical Order; Last Name, First Name): Champernowne, Claire; Getty, Ethan; Henderson, Paul (Withdrew); Kong, Elliot; Nikitenko, Anton (Withdrew)<br>
Assignment 1: Using the provided 'leaned_processed.cleveland.data' database and the Sci-Kit Learn library breast cancer database, developed, optimized, and analyzed supervised machine learning models using decision trees, random forests, and neural network models.<br>
Assignment 2: Using the Fashion-MNIST library from Zalando Research, developed, optimized, and analyzed supervised machine learning models using logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM) models. Implemented custom k-fold cross-validation methodology.<br>
Assignment 3: Using a provided database, developed, optimized, and analyzed unsupervised machine learning models using Lloyd's algorithm (k-means) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. k-means implementation was custom, using either uniform random initialization or k-means++ initialization.<br>
Group Project: Our group used the National Cancer Institute's (NIH) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) (https://seer.cancer.gov/) database to train various supervised machine learning models  to develop a potential prognostic model of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (head and neck cancer subset) and compare it to traditional survival curves.<br>
